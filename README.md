In this web app, there are users and groups. Each user can be a part of multiple groups and can view information about their groups like the motto and how many pets in total the group has. The current user and group can be selected from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.

The app currently has a bug: *Some* users can't see the groups they're in or information about them.
Find the cause of this issue and resolve the bug.
